# CEDUBAM
Cost Effective Diagnosing Using a BAyesian system Model

This app is a part of my master thesis Computer Science at Open University, Netherlands. So all concepts and computations are closely related to them. If you are interested in the text of the thesis itself, send me an email.

STARTING THE PROGRAM
Copy  the 2 jars â€˜bayesserver-9.5.jar in folder 'lib', cedbam-xxx.jar in folder 'target' and folder 'resources' (scripts and systems) to a folder on your local PC.
The program can be started in the CLI. Go to the directory of the program. Then type
java -cp ./* app.App
or, if a valid license key for bayesserver  is available,
java -cp ./* app.App license:<bayesserver-licence-key>
The program starts and the commands can be typed.
A java version of JDK-13 is required.

A list and explanation of the commands is available in the mainpage of this project.
